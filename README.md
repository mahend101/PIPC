# PIPC
**Performance oriented IPC library**

InterProcess Communication is essential to modular software developments. But present solutions are either too difficult to implement (one has to invent the wheel again) or too slow to consider. When every microseconds matter, then there must be an efficient and self sufficient easy to use IPC library needed. This project aims to provide this.

## Goals
Goals are
* Easy to use 
* Performance is the ultimate goal
